    <h1>Data Compression</h1>
    <p>Invention Research</p>
    <p>By Benjamin Davies</p>
  </header>
  <section>
    <p>Data compression is when you shrink the size of data while still conveying the same information. This is useful when
      you need to send some data that usualy takes up a lot of space over a network. Some examples of digital data are documents,
      apps, videos, and game saves.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>How do we measure data size?</h1>
    <p>The smallest amount of data we can have is called a bit. A bit represents an on/off decision. One way to think about
      a bit is like a light bulb, which is either on or off.</p>
    <p>While a bit can only have two states, if we compine bits then they can have lots more states. For instance, if we take
      eight bits, we can have two hundred and fifty six states. We call a group of eight bits a byte.</p>
    <p>For larger data we can use different measurements.</p>

    <h1>What are the different types of data compression and how are they used?</h1>
    <p>There are two main types of data compression: lossy and lossless.</p>
    <div class="two-col">
      <div class="col">
        <h3>Lossy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Does not exactly represent all of the original data. Instead, it ignores redundant details to save space.</li>
          <li>Used for images, audio and video as we can barely tell the difference.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <h3>Lossless</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Exactly represents all of the original data.</li>
          <li>Used for documents and apps, where any differences in the data can be really bad.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

  <section>
    <h1>How was Data Compression first used?</h1>
    <p>Data Compression has been, and still is, used to minimize the transmition time of information. The earliest example of
      this is Morse Code, which was used to communicate over primitive and unreliable radios.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Morse code, invented in 1838, is the earliest instance of data compression in that the most common letters in the English
        language such as “e” and “t” are given shorter Morse codes.</p>

    <h1>How has Data Compression improved our everyday life?</h1>
    <p>Data compression reduces the ammount of bits we need to send, and in turn the ammount of work we need to do to send the
      information.
